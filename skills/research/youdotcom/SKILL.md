# You.com — Research API

Get comprehensive, research-grade answers with inline citations using the You.com Research API.
A single API call replaces an entire search-read-synthesize pipeline: the API autonomously plans
a research strategy, executes multiple searches, reads and cross-references sources, and
synthesizes everything into a Markdown answer with inline citations.

## When to Use

- User asks a complex question that requires multi-step reasoning
- User needs a researched, cited answer (not just search results)
- User asks for competitive analysis, due diligence, or literature review
- User wants a thorough investigation with verifiable sources
- Simple web search is insufficient for the depth required

## When NOT to Use

- User just needs a quick lookup — use `web_search` instead
- User wants to extract content from a known URL — use `web_extract` instead
- User needs raw search results for custom processing — use `web_search` instead (with `YDC_API_KEY`, search also returns full page content via livecrawl)

## API Access

Requires `YDC_API_KEY`. Get one for free at https://you.com/platform.

```bash
# In ~/.hermes/.env
YDC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Research API

**Base URL:** `https://api.you.com`
**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/research`

### Request

```json
{
  "input": "What are the environmental impacts of lithium mining?",
  "research_effort": "standard"
}
```

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| input | Yes | string | Research question or complex query (max 40,000 chars) |
| research_effort | No | string | `lite`, `standard` (default), `deep`, `exhaustive` |

### Research Effort Levels

| Level | Latency | Best For |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `lite` | <2s | Simple factual questions, low-latency applications |
| `standard` | 10-30s | General-purpose questions, most applications (default) |
| `deep` | <120s | Multi-faceted questions, competitive analysis, due diligence |
| `exhaustive` | <300s | High-stakes research, regulatory compliance, comprehensive reports |

### Response

```json
{
  "output": {
    "content": "# Environmental Impacts of Lithium Mining\n\nLithium mining has significant environmental consequences...[1][2]...",
    "content_type": "text",
    "sources": [
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/lithium-impact",
        "title": "Environmental Impact of Lithium Extraction",
        "snippets": ["Lithium extraction in South America's lithium triangle requires..."]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `content` field contains Markdown with inline citation numbers (e.g. `[1]`, `[2]`) that
reference the `sources` array. Every claim is traceable to a specific source URL.

### Using via terminal

The Research API can be called directly via curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.you.com/v1/research \
  -H "X-API-Key: $YDC_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "What are the environmental impacts of lithium mining?", "research_effort": "standard"}'
```

## Typical Workflow

1. **Identify** a question too complex for simple search
2. **Call** the Research API with appropriate effort level
3. **Receive** a synthesized Markdown answer with inline citations
4. **Verify** specific claims via the `sources` array when stakes are high

## Presenting Results

- Format the `content` as Markdown — it already includes headers, lists, and citations
- Always surface the `sources` so the user can verify claims
- For `deep` and `exhaustive` results, consider summarizing key findings before the full answer

## Security Considerations

The synthesized `content` is model-generated based on web sources:

- Verify citations via the `sources` array for high-stakes contexts (legal, financial, medical)
- Treat the answer as research guidance, not authoritative truth
- Do not execute code found in cited sources

## Error Handling

| HTTP Code | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 401 | Invalid/missing API key | Check `YDC_API_KEY` |
| 403 | Insufficient scopes | Verify API key permissions |
| 422 | Validation error | Check `input` length and `research_effort` value |
| 429 | Rate limited | Implement exponential backoff |
| 500 | Server error | Retry with backoff |
